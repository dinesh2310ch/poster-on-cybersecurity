## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project was developed with Python 3.8, but it should be compatible with Python 3.6 and above.

You'll need to install a few Python libraries. You can install them using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install pillow opencv-python tk webbrowser
```

- **Pillow (PIL Fork)** is used for image processing tasks, such as loading images, applying filters, and creating dynamic GIFs.
- **OpenCV-Python** is utilized for video processing within the Tkinter canvas.
- **Tkinter** is Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package, and it comes pre-installed with Python. If you're using a minimal Python installation, you may need to install it separately.
- **Webbrowser** is a module in Python used for launching a web browser. This should come with the standard Python library, so you don't need to install it separately.
